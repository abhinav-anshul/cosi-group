# Welcome to Cosi Group Web Check-in.

## Fire up https://cosi.abhinavanshul.com for live demo.

## This is a React Application built using CRA template. The Tech Stack I have used here are :

1. ReactJS - Framework
2. Chakra UI - Design System
3. Framer Motion - For minor animation
4. Axios - For API calls
5. React Router DOM - For Component based navigation through pages
6. Eslint/Prettier - For locally Prettifying Code.
7. Mocki API - For posting dummy data and receiving a message.
8. Finally I have chosen Netlify for project deployment.

## Walkthrough :

1. A welcome Screen requiring users to put data such as lastname and the flight number.
2. Once Submitted, user needs to fill in the form about personal details.
3. Read through the Terms & Condition, review the details.
4. If something needs to be corrected, one can always go back and re-correct.
5. Finally, A Confirmation Screen, where user would be verified about the Success message.
